Good afternoon French, Romans, countrymen. I mean families and friends from England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, California and Montreal. Today marks the biggest `merge request` in Github's history, the union of Christopher and Sophia.

As software developers, they spend months, years and even decades in the near future writing codes, fixing bugs and pushing updates. But today they are committed to far greater, a lifetime `repository` together, where `love` is the main branch.

Forgive the analogy, this is just dull but with marriage you plan, design and build with great enthusiasm. Along the way, you may find bugs, a few unexpected exceptions but with teamwork in debugging, looking at the stacktrace, log files and dashboards, marriage will evolve into reliable, resilient, scalable and beautiful.

What makes Chris and Sophia special, is that they're not just excellent developers of software, but also developers of life together. They met each other at Surrey University, studied together, finished homework, courseworks and thesis together. They graduated with honors together and that's the `alpha` copy of their friendship. Couple of years ago, Chris proposed and that's the `beta` copy of their friendship. Then they bought a property somewhere in Berkshire and that must be the `release candidate`.Today they officially released the version 1.0 of their marriage.

With marriage, you can follow the agile ceremony. Please avoid `waterfall`, you know what I mean. You can do dailies, sprint plannings, refinement sessions and most especially retrospectives. Your marriage will require constant updates, a little patch here and there, a bit of refactoring.

So let's raise a glass to a love that never crashes, to a partnership with zero downtime and to a lifetime of `commits` that only makes marriage resilient.

Here's to Chris and Sophia, may your marriage stay bug-free.

Cheers!
